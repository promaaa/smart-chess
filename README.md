# SmartChess

SmartChess aims to build an intelligent electronic chessboard that automatically detects piece positions with reed sensors and drives visual indicators through LEDs. The repository is structured to support the project milestones: 2x2 proof of concept, 8x8 mockup, Raspberry Pi integration, and the final connected application.

## Repository layout

- `prototypes/`: hardware and firmware for the physical prototypes.
  - `2x2-prototype/`: Palier 1 demonstrator (hardware, firmware, experiment notes).
  - `8x8-maquette/`: Paliers 2 & 3 mockup (hardware, firmware, Raspberry Pi controller, validation, system design).
- `ai/`: research and development around the SmartChess AI (models, training, inference, datasets).
- `docs/`: central documentation (roadmap, bill of materials, guides).
- `deliverables/`: outward-facing assets (demos, presentations, media).
- `tools/`: shared scripts plus calibration utilities.
