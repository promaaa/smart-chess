# IA-Marc V2 - Requirements
# Optimized Chess Engine for Raspberry Pi 5

# Core chess library
python-chess>=1.999

# Optional: Performance monitoring
psutil>=5.9.0

# Optional: Parallel processing utilities
# (threading is built-in, but these can help)

# Development/Testing
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0

# Optional: For UCI protocol support (if needed)
# chess-uci>=0.0.5

# Optional: For opening book management
# Note: We'll implement a simple JSON-based opening book
# No external dependency needed

# Optional: For web API (if needed)
# flask>=2.3.0
# flask-cors>=4.0.0

# Optional: Numba for JIT compilation (advanced optimization)
# numba>=0.57.0
# Note: May require LLVM, test compatibility on RPi 5 first

# Note on PyPy:
# For best performance, use PyPy3 instead of CPython
# Installation: sudo apt install pypy3
# Run with: pypy3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Then: pypy3 your_script.py

# Compatibility notes:
# - Tested on Python 3.8+
# - Recommended: Python 3.10+ or PyPy3 3.9+
# - Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit recommended for best performance
